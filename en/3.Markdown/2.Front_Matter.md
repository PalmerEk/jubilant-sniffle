### Front Matter

Front Matter allows you to add additional "meta" data to your pages. This data is used to add additional information to your pages. For example, the title and description are used to populate the OpenGraph and Twitter Card meta data. This allows you to customize the title and description that is displayed when you share a link to your page.
